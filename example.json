The virtual theremin can be controlled either with mouse/touch inputs or with gestures through a webcam via human pose tracking provided by PoseNet. This app celebrates the 100th anniversary of the theremin, invented by Léon Theremin in 1920. A century after its conception, the theremin continues to be a flexible electronic instrument with an ethereal tone.<br><br>Site of the Day and Dev Award from <a href=\"https://www.awwwards.com/sites/theremix-virtual-theremin\" target=\"blank\">Awwwards</a>, <a href=\"https://thefwa.com/cases/theremix-virtual-theremin\" target=\"blank\">The FWA</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cssdesignawards.com/sites/theremix-virtual-theremin/37544/\" target=\"blank\">CSS Design Awards</a>, and featured on Muzli. <br><br>It is also currently nominated for best music website at the <a href=\"https://vote.webbyawards.com/PublicVoting#/2021/websites-and-mobile-sites/general-websites-and-mobile-sites/music\" target=\"blank\">Webby Awards</a>!

Primarily a Rembrandt historian, he has made it his life's work to challenging the ideas of the institution on \"What is a Rembrandt?\" and is devoted to the idea that different ways of visualizing Rembrandt's ouvre is crucial in pinpointing which paintings are by Rembrandt and which are falsely attributed to him.\n<br><br>\nFor this first stage of work, I created a website that would feature Binstock's mission statement as its main content with clickable links to images referenced. Some images also have SVG illustrations that animate when loaded. This visual flair will allude to how image annotations in a more analytical article would be styled.

We would then isolate and colorize each object and pattern the object for each student spread. In order to recognize our year as the first graduating class to stray from Cooper Union's mission of free education, we also wanted to make sure that the costs that went into the yearbook remained transparent. We totalled the costs for photography, design and printing, and also added the estimated value of all the objects brought.",
