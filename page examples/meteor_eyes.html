<h1 id=>Game Demo: Meteor-eyes</h1>
<p>
    This is a project that I've created to learn Unity in depth. Except for the primitive shapes and textures, everything was created by me.
    The character was designed, rigged and animated by me (none of these are my strenghts). All vfx were created using Unity's VFX graph and shader graph.
    The game uses the universal render pipeline and the built-in lighting system with some post-processing.
    <br>
    Some features:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Player respawns on death </li>
    <li> Player can shoot  and use a sword slash attack </li>
    <li> Player can use a shield to block incoming attacks </li>
    <li> Shield use has a cooldown period </li>
    <li> Shields can be picked up </li>
    <li> Enemies spawn in waves </li>
    <li> There are two sections in the demo, each section has its own waves and enemies</li>
    <li> Some enemies can shoot, and have different behaviours </li>
    <li> Enemies drop health or shields according to a drop rate </li>
    <li> There are different rarities for items (common, rare, super, ultra, ultimate) even though right now the only items are shields and health. </li>
</ul>
