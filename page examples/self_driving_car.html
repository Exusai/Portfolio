<p>This convolutional neural network is based on PilotNet but includes a set of convolutional layers dedicated to process information from a LIDAR sensor as an image:</p>

<p>To train the network, manual data was recovered using a manual control node based on the ROS's joy node. Then, the data was uploaded to Google Drive in order to use Google Colab. Both models (with lidar and no lidar) were trainded for around 10 epochs on approximately 82746 images each using the tensorflow input pipeline. After the first 3 epochs convolutional layers and dense layers were alternately "frozen" in to let the other type of layer reduce error on it's own.</p>
